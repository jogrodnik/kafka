3. Docker Image Creation for Kafka Confluent 6.2.8:

Selected the appropriate base images for Kafka Confluent 6.2.8, including Kafka, ZooKeeper, and Schema Registry.
Defined Dockerfiles for each component, outlining installation and configuration steps.
Customized configurations to align with the specific use case, addressing broker settings, security requirements, and topic configurations.
Successfully built and tested the Docker images in a local environment.
4. Helm Chart Implementation for Kafka Cluster on GKE:

Developed comprehensive Helm charts covering Kafka, ZooKeeper, Schema Registry, and associated components.
Employed dynamic Helm values to facilitate adaptable Kafka deployments.
Incorporated GKE-specific settings within the Helm charts, encompassing considerations like node pools, persistent volumes, and load balancers.
Conducted thorough testing of the Helm charts in a controlled environment to ensure reliable deployment.
5. Performance Testing on Kafka Cluster on GKE:

Formulated diverse performance testing scenarios, reflective of real-world usage patterns, encompassing high throughput and low latency scenarios.
Utilized industry-standard tools such as Apache JMeter and Gatling to orchestrate simulated workloads and capture key performance metrics.
Rigorously monitored Kafka cluster metrics throughout the testing phase, promptly identifying potential performance bottlenecks and anomalies.
Derived actionable insights from performance testing data, optimizing resource allocation and configurations for enhanced Kafka performance.
6. Monitoring Stack Installation (Prometheus and Grafana):

Orchestrated the deployment of Prometheus, tailoring scraping configurations to harvest Kafka metrics effectively.
Designed and configured Grafana dashboards to visualize pertinent Kafka cluster performance metrics intuitively.
Introduced Prometheus-based alerting mechanisms to proactively signal critical events and performance deviations.
Thoroughly validated the monitoring infrastructure's functionality through meticulously simulated scenarios, confirming timely alerting and accurate metric visualization.
7. Installation and Configuration of Mirror Maker 2.0:

Gained a comprehensive understanding of the role and data flow of Mirror Maker 2.0 within the architectural context.
Successfully deployed and configured Mirror Maker 2.0, diligently specifying source and target clusters for seamless data synchronization.
Tailored topic mappings and potential transformations to meet specific use-case requirements.
Validated the mirroring process through controlled tests, confirming data consistency and synchronization accuracy.
8. Performance Testing of Mirror Maker 2.0 Mirroring:

Crafted a robust testing framework to assess the performance of Mirror Maker 2.0, comprising scenarios involving high data volume and simulated failover conditions.
Leveraged established performance testing tools and methodologies to scrutinize the efficiency and latency of the mirroring process.
Monitored source and target clusters closely throughout testing, promptly detecting and addressing any discrepancies or latency fluctuations.
Leveraged insights derived from performance testing to fine-tune and optimize Mirror Maker 2.0 configurations for enhanced mirroring efficiency.
Feel free to use these rephrased points in your report. Adapt the language as needed to fit your context and writing style.


The implementation of the Kafka image on GKE consists of two independent parts. The base image creates the appropriate directory structure adapted to the Unity 
standard and required for the correct execution of individual Kafka cluster components.
The detailed configuration of individual layers of the Docker image is described in the clonfluent.docker file.
