The implementation of the Kafka image on GKE is comprised of two distinct components. The base image serves as the foundational layer, establishing a directory structure customized to Unity standards, 
which is crucial for the proper operation of individual Kafka cluster components. Additionally, subsequent layers within this image include certificates and the JMX-exporter. For a detailed understanding 
of the configuration of each layer within the Docker image, please refer to the clonfluent.docker file.

The base image acts as the cornerstone for both the Kafka on GKE and MirrorMaker 2.0 images.

Within the Kafka on GKE image, there's an integrated script that configures the essential Kafka cluster components. Comprehensive insights into this process can be found in the docker-k8s script. 
The remaining layers of the image are defined within the confluent.gke.dockerfile file.

The MM2 image introduces an additional feature to the base image â€“ a class that removes the default prefix from the destination topic name. The source code for this class is available 
in the mm2-prefixes-policy.zip file. A comprehensive description of each layer can be found in the confluent.mm2.docker file.
