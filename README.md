Enable Detailed SSL/TLS Debugging
Java's SSL/TLS implementation includes a detailed debugging mechanism that can be enabled by setting the javax.net.debug system property. You can enable this debugging in several ways:

Via Command Line: Add the following option when starting your Java application:

bash
Copy code
-Djavax.net.debug=ssl,handshake
This enables detailed debugging of SSL handshakes. For even more detailed output, you can use all instead of ssl,handshake, but be aware that this will produce a very large amount of output.

In Code: You can also set this property programmatically at the very beginning of your main method or before any SSL activities occur:

java

Copy code
System.setProperty("javax.net.debug", "ssl,handshake");
Understanding the Debug Output
The debug output will include a lot of information. Here are some key things to look for:

Handshake Messages: Look for the handshake messages exchanged between the client and server. This includes ClientHello, ServerHello, Certificate, ServerKeyExchange, CertificateRequest, ServerHelloDone, CertificateVerify, ClientKeyExchange, Finished, etc.
Alerts: Pay attention to any SSL/TLS alerts that are sent, which can indicate errors. For example, Received fatal alert: bad_certificate points towards a certificate issue.
Cipher Suites: Check the cipher suites offered by the client and the ones accepted by the server. Ensure that there is at least one cipher suite in common and it is supported and enabled on both sides.
Certificates: Verify that the certificates are correctly exchanged and validate properly. Look for any messages about certificate validation failing.

Once Kafka is installed in the GKE environment of the project, only the initial read operation will involve communication between the GKE cluster and the on-premises Kafka. Subsequent steps in the pipeline will rely on internal topics within the dedicated Kafka broker of the project. This means that after the initial read, the data processing and flow within the pipeline will be handled internally by the project's Kafka infrastructure. The diagram below illustrates this change in operation.

We have structured the project implementation into four distinct stages:

Docker Image Creation for Kafka Confluent:
We have created Docker images that encompass the necessary components for Kafka Confluent. These images serve as the foundation for the Kafka environment within the project.

Separate Kafka Cluster Development and Implementation for the Unity Project:
We have developed and implemented a dedicated Kafka cluster specifically tailored for the Unity project. Using Helm, we have streamlined the installation process, ensuring seamless deployment and configuration of the Kafka cluster.

Version Upgrade Process and Integration with Unity 2.0 Monitoring Subsystem:
We have devised a robust process to seamlessly upgrade the Kafka cluster to newer versions. Furthermore, we have integrated it with the standard Unity 2.0 monitoring subsystem, leveraging Prometheus and Grafana. This integration allows for efficient monitoring and management of the Kafka cluster's performance and health.

Performance Testing of the Kafka Cluster:
We have conducted comprehensive performance tests on the Kafka cluster to evaluate its capabilities and ensure optimal performance. These tests have provided valuable insights into the cluster's scalability, throughput, and reliability, enabling us to fine-tune and optimize its performance.

By following these stages, we have ensured a well-structured and efficient implementation of the Kafka infrastructure for the project, delivering a reliable and high-performing system.

Kafka Installation on Kubernetes
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing Apache Kafka on Kubernetes.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

Kubernetes cluster up and running
kubectl command-line tool installed and configured to communicate with your cluster
Step 1: Create Kafka Namespace
Create a namespace for Kafka deployment:

bash
Copy code
kubectl create namespace kafka
Step 2: Deploy ZooKeeper
ZooKeeper is a prerequisite for Kafka. Deploy a ZooKeeper instance using the following command:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f zookeeper.yaml -n kafka
Note: Make sure you have the zookeeper.yaml file, which contains the ZooKeeper deployment configuration.

Step 3: Deploy Kafka
Deploy the Kafka cluster using the following command:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f kafka.yaml -n kafka
Note: Make sure you have the kafka.yaml file, which contains the Kafka deployment configuration.

Step 4: Verify Kafka Deployment
Wait for the Kafka deployment to be ready:

bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods -n kafka
Ensure that all Kafka pods are in the Running state before proceeding.

Step 5: Access Kafka
To access Kafka, you need to expose it as a Kubernetes service:

bash
Copy code
kubectl expose deployment kafka --type=LoadBalancer --port=9092 --name=kafka-service -n kafka
Step 6: Test Kafka
You can now test Kafka by connecting to the Kafka service. Get the external IP of the Kafka service:

bash
Copy code
kubectl get services kafka-service -n kafka
Use the obtained external IP and the port (9092 by default) to connect to Kafka from your Kafka clients or applications.

Step 7: Cleanup
To clean up the Kafka deployment, you can delete the Kafka namespace:

bash
Copy code
kubectl delete namespace kafka
Warning: This will delete all resources associated with the Kafka deployment. Make sure to back up any important data before performing this step.

Conclusion
You have successfully installed Kafka on Kubernetes. You can now use Kafka to build scalable and distributed streaming applications.

For more information and advanced configurations, please refer to the Kafka documentation.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or encounter any issues during the installation process.

The Kubernetes API server may log authentication and authorization events for auditing purposes, providing administrators with an audit trail to track access to the Kubernetes cluster.
Remember, the specific configurations and claim names may differ slightly based on the version of Keycloak and the customizations made in the OIDC setup. Always consult the official Keycloak documentation and the Kubernetes documentation for the most up-to-date and accurate integration instructions.

Kafka MirrorMaker 2 (MM2):
- Kafka MirrorMaker 2 is a built-in tool within the Apache Kafka ecosystem.
- It is designed for replicating data between two separate Kafka clusters.
- MM2 is an enhanced version of the original MirrorMaker tool, offering advanced features and improved performance.
- Key features include multi-cluster replication, configurability, fault tolerance, and high throughput.

Kafka Connect:
- Kafka Connect is a framework and toolset for building connectors between Kafka and other data systems.
- Connectors enable seamless integration of data between Kafka and various external sources or sinks.
- Connectors can be source connectors (bringing data into Kafka) or sink connectors (sending data out of Kafka).
- The framework is designed for scalability, fault tolerance, and ease of use through configuration.
- Kafka Connect offers a REST API for managing connectors and monitoring their tasks.

Relation between Kafka MirrorMaker 2 and Kafka Connect:
- Kafka MirrorMaker 2 serves as a specialized use case of Kafka Connect.
- It focuses on replicating data between Kafka clusters exclusively.
- While Kafka Connect supports a wide range of connectors for diverse systems, MirrorMaker 2 is optimized for Kafka-to-Kafka replication.
- Essentially, MirrorMaker 2 is a dedicated connector tailored for high-throughput data replication between Kafka clusters.
