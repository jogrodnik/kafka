General Debugging Options
all: Enables all debugging.
ssl: Enables all SSL debugging.
SSL/TLS Debugging Options
Within SSL/TLS debugging, you can further refine what you want to debug by specifying a comma-separated list of the following options:

record: Enables logging of SSL/TLS records, which are the basic units of data exchanged in an SSL/TLS connection.
handshake: Prints each handshake message, providing insight into the negotiation between client and server.
keygen: Shows key generation data.
session: Logs session activity, useful for understanding session reuse.
defaultctx: Displays default SSL context information.
sslctx: Shows SSL context tracing.
sessioncache: Debugs SSL session cache access.
keymanager: Logs key manager activity, including selection decisions for the encryption keys.
trustmanager: Debugs trust manager activities, such as certificate validation.
pluggability: Debugs pluggability (e.g., JSSE provider selection and loading).
Examples
Debug Handshake and Key Generation:

bash
Copy code
-Djavax.net.debug=handshake,keygen
This configuration is useful for understanding the details of the key exchange process during the handshake.

Debug Session Management and Trust Manager Decisions:

bash
Copy code
-Djavax.net.debug=session,trustmanager
This helps in diagnosing issues related to session reuse and certificate validation.
