Cluster Metrics

Cluster level overview of workloads deployed

Cluster CPU usage: used vs. total
Cluster memory usage: used vs. total (you can configure this in the memory-defaults.yaml file under the default-mem-example namespace)
Cluster file system usage: used vs. total
Cluster network I/O pressure
Cluster health (pod status, pod restarts, pod throttling)
Overview of nodes, pods, and containers

Node Metrics

Health check for master nodes—API server, scheduler, controller, etc.
Degradation of master nodes
Number of nodes available for serving pods
Node CPU utilization
Node memory usage
Node disk space available for placing pods
Node disk I/O usage
Node network traffic (in and out)—receive and transmit 
Node network traffic errors
Node network traffic drop 


Pod/Container Metrics


Resource allocation for pods
Pods which are either underprovisioned or overprovisioned
Number of running pods in the cluster
Healthy vs. unhealthy pods in the cluster
Percentage of throttled containers
Number of container restarts that have occurred
Number of persistent volumes in a failed or pending state
Container CPU and memory utilization (you can configure this in the memory-defaults-pod.yaml file for each pod or container)
